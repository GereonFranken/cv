# Cv

Welcome to the Repository of my CV, thanks for visiting.

This CV is written in Angular and hosted with [Github Pages](https://gereonfranken.github.io/cv/). Please feel free to see the CV in action!

If you are planning to use elements of this repository, be aware that I overkilled the scope of a CV website. I used [Angular](https://angular.io/) which is normally used for huge applications and also introduced state management with [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/) for currently one simple boolean flag. I did this because I wanted to try out several things and also to build a scalable application from the start. This does not mean that its the best solution by any means though. Depending on your use case, maybe you are better off using a different Framework or even simple HTML, CSS and Javascript for the matter. This would make your application way more lightweight as well.

Otherwise, feel free to use whatever you like :)
